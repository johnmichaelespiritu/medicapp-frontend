## Features

### User Authentication

The login feature requires users to enter their registered credentials, such as email address and password, to log in.

### Registration and Account Creation

New users can register and create their accounts within the system. During registration, users provide essential details, such as their name, email address, and desired password.

### Password Reset and Recovery

The system allows users to reset their passwords in case they forget them. A verification code is sent to users' registered email addresses for verification and security.
